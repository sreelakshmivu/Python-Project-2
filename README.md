Exploratory Data Analysis

Introduction:

This project,  provide a analysis of the employee dataset from ABC Company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The dataset includes information about employees, such as team, position, age, and salary. 

Dataset Preprocessing:One notable correction involved the 'height' column, where incorrect data was identified. To rectify this, I replaced the entries with random height values ranging between 150 and 180.

Aim:

Team Distribution: Determine the number of employees in each team and provide the percentage distribution relative to the total workforce.

Position Segregation: Segregate employees based on their positions within the company, offering insights into the distribution of roles.

Age Group Distribution: Identifying the age group among employees.

High Spending Analysis: Point out the teams and positions where salary expenditures are high.

Correlation between Age and Salary: Employing visual representation, explore the correlation between age and salary to discern any trends within the dataset.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) refers to the method of studying and exploring record sets to apprehend their predominant traits, discover patterns, locate outliers, and identify relationships between variables. EDA is normally carried out as a preliminary step before undertaking extra formal statistical analyses or modeling.

Introduction:

This project,  provide a analysis of the employee dataset from ABC Company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The dataset includes information about employees, such as team, position, age, and salary. 

Dataset Preprocessing:One notable correction involved the 'height' column, where incorrect data was identified. To rectify this, I replaced the entries with random height values ranging between 150 and 180.

Aim:

Team Distribution: Determine the number of employees in each team and provide the percentage distribution relative to the total workforce.

Position Segregation: Segregate employees based on their positions within the company, offering insights into the distribution of roles.

Age Group Distribution: Identifying the age group among employees.

High Spending Analysis: Point out the teams and positions where salary expenditures are high.

Correlation between Age and Salary: Employing visual representation, explore the correlation between age and salary to discern any trends within the dataset.

This analysis provides insights into the composition of employees in each team, their positions, age distribution, salary spending, and the relationship between age and salary.
